# Predictive Data Analytics – Customer Behaviour Case Study

## 1. Overview 

This project is a university data analytics case study for CAB330 (Data and Web Analytics) at QUT.
We analyse four datasets (audio tracks, transactions, movies and weblog) to understand customer
behaviour using clustering, association rule mining, text mining, and web usage mining.


## 2. Business Questions 

- Which customer segments can we identify from transaction behaviour?
- What product combinations are frequently bought together?
- How can we recommend movies or content based on textual descriptions?
- What are the most common navigation paths on the website?

## 3. Techniques & Tools 

- **Data processing:** Python, pandas, numpy
- **Clustering:** k-means, hierarchical clustering
- **Association rules:** Apriori, support–confidence–lift
- **Text mining:** TF–IDF, cosine similarity
- **Web usage mining:** session identification, path analysis
- **Visualisation:** matplotlib, seaborn
