##  1. Overview

This repository contains my analytical case study for **CAB330 – Data and Web Analytics** at QUT.  
The project investigates **customer behaviour** using four datasets:

- Audio tracks  
- Retail transactions  
- Movie descriptions  
- Web server logs  

Across these datasets, the goal is to understand user patterns, product relationships, content similarity, and navigation behaviour using a range of predictive analytics techniques.

This project addresses several key analytical questions:

1. **What customer segments exist based on transaction behaviour?**  
2. **Which product combinations are frequently purchased together?**  
3. **How can we recommend movies or content based on textual similarity?**  
4. **What are the most common user navigation paths on the website?**
